Peripherals
===========

This directory is for files I've made along the way that I want to hang onto,
but aren't part of anything yet.

* `*.def`: Results from `dict://dict.org/d:*` requests, usually named by the
    word requested.
* `*.show`: Results from `dict://dict.org/show*` requests, usually named for
  the specific show command.
* One-off scripts.
